# Challenge:

There should be 3 REST API delivered as a backend service:
1. REST API to return probability is 50% when catching Pokemon.
2. REST API to release pokemon. This API should return a prime number, if the number returned by the API is not a prime number, then release will fail and vice versa.
3. REST API to rename pokemon. This function should return a combination of first name assigned combined with Fibonacci sequence, e.g.:
• First name assigned is “Mighty Pikachu”, first time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-0”
• Second time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-1”
• Third time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-1”
• Fourth time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-2”, and so on.
